Compilation of various math packages written in Go.

- [Extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm), `eea`, computes the greatest common divisor of two intergers, their Bezout's coefficients, and quotients with their greatest common divisor. 

- [Rijndael](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic#Rijndael.27s_finite_field), `rijndael`, functions for working in Rijndael's finite field and working with the Rijndael key schedule.
